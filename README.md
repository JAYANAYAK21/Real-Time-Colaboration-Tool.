# DESCRIPTION

A Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that enables multiple users to simultaneously create, edit, and manage documents with live synchronization. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, the platform combines frontend interactivity, backend logic, and database storage to offer a seamless collaborative experience.

At its core, the system utilizes WebSockets to ensure real-time communication between clients and the server. This allows instant propagation of text changes, cursor movements, and formatting across all active users working on the same document. A rich text editor (e.g., Quill) is integrated to provide users with intuitive text formatting features such as bold, italics, headings, and lists.

User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), enabling secure access through protected routes. Registered users can create new documents, access existing ones, and share them via secure, unique links. Each document is associated with a version history, allowing for tracking changes and reverting to earlier revisions if needed.

The application also includes features such as live cursor position sharing, responsive design for compatibility with various devices, and robust document management (create, read, update, delete). The use of MongoDB as the database ensures scalable and flexible storage of user data and document content.

This type of platform is ideal for collaborative work environments, educational tools, and content creation platforms where real-time interaction and data consistency are critical. Future enhancements may include audio/video chat integration, commenting systems, markdown support, mobile application development, file attachments, and document templates to extend functionality and user engagement.
